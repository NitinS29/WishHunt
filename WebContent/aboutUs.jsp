	<p>Have you ever had a feeling you wished to learn something, 
	but never really got a chance to actually learn it? How exciting 
	would it be if you get to pursue your wish and acquire a different skillset? 
	Isn&#8217;t it exciting to teach people what you know and  get paid for it, that 
	too in your spare time? We have a solution that exactly serves this purpose.</p>
	
	<p>Wish Hunt connects users who wish to procure some service or 
	need a platform to sell their services, by granting people&#8217;s long 
	lost wishes, or may be helping a teenager acquire new and useful skills. 
	These services are mostly non-materialistic and hence usually don&#8217;t find 
	a place in eCommerce.</p>
	<p>This website is an open platform for everyone and does not require any qualification. People all 
	over have so much to offer, so much to give. Wish Hunt also delivers a stage 
	for people with quirky talents which cannot usually be monetized to display their 
	skills and get paid when people avail their services. </p>
	
	<p>The website has a provision of adding activities which will provide 
	the users with the information about events, workshops happening around them. 
	They can reach out to the activity organizer and attend these activities if it 
	interests them. They can also collaborate with them separately and take personal 
	lessons if the activities peak their interests further.</p>
		
	<p>Wish Hunt aims at helping people grow together for a better life.</p>
